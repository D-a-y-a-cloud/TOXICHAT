🧠 ToxiChat — Train Toxicity Detection ML Model
=================================================
This script trains a toxicity classifier and saves:
  - models/model.pkl          (Logistic Regression classifier)
  - models/tfidf_vectorizer.pkl (TF-IDF text vectorizer)

These files are loaded automatically by the backend.

Usage:
